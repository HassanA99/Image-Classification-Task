Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Differences:

AlexNet and VGG: Classified Dog_01.jpg as Rhodesian Ridgeback.
ResNet: Classified Dog_01.jpg as Irish Terrier.
There is a discrepancy in breed classification among the models.



2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
Differences:

AlexNet: Classified Dog_01.jpg as Rhodesian Ridgeback and Dog_02.jpg as Australian Terrier. Different breeds.
VGG: Classified Dog_01.jpg as Rhodesian Ridgeback and Dog_02.jpg as Vizsla. Different breeds.
ResNet: Misclassified Dog_02.jpg as Warthog (which is not a dog), while Dog_01.jpg was classified as Irish Terrier. Significant difference in classification.

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer:
Misclassifications:

AlexNet: Misclassified Cattle_01.jpg as Water Buffalo and Coffee_mug_01.jpg as Eggnog.
VGG: Misclassified Cattle_01.jpg as Water Buffalo and Coffee_mug_01.jpg as Eggnog.
ResNet: Misclassified Cattle_01.jpg as Ox but correctly classified Coffee_mug_01.jpg as Coffee Mug.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.
Answer:

Selected Model: ResNet

Justification:

Correct Classification of Non-Dogs: ResNet correctly classified Coffee_mug_01.jpg as Coffee Mug, whereas AlexNet and VGG incorrectly classified both.
Correct Classification of Dogs: While ResNet had some issues with breed classification (Dog_01.jpg as Irish Terrier and Dog_02.jpg as Warthog), it was the only model to correctly identify Coffee_mug_01.jpg.
Overall Performance: Despite some misclassifications, ResNet demonstrated a better balance of correct classifications and fewer incorrect results compared to AlexNet and VGG.
Given that ResNet correctly identified one of the non-dog images, it was chosen as the model that performed best in terms of overall accuracy, particularly with non-dog images.
