his project utilizes pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models to classify images of dogs into their respective breeds. The models used in this project include AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to correctly identify the breed of a dog given an image using state-of-the-art deep learning models. The project also includes functionality to differentiate between images of dogs and non-dog images.
